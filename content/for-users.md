title: What does GPC do?

When you send a Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal, you **tell websites that you don’t want your personal information sold or shared.** 

GPC is a flag raised wherever you surf the web. Every time you visit a website, the flag is shown to the website, hidden in HTML header or JavaScript code. The flag signals that you want your privacy to be protected, opting out of as much data sharing as possible.

Many websites watch for GPC signals and respect them. These sites will see your flag and make changes to the site to better respect your privacy. Usually, this means they’ll cut back on the number of cookies collecting data and limit some data sharing.  


---LegalNote
---
Depending on where you live, the GPC flag can exercise your legal right to opt out. For example, if you live in California or Colorado, some sites are legally bound to respect your GPC signal by not selling your data.

You can turn on GPC through web browsers. *Over 40 million people have already started flying the flag. If you have multiple devices or browsers, you need to turn the flag on for each one separately. 

Here’s how to get started with some of the major browsers. For more options, see [the full list](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#download) on the GPC site.

| Brave	 | Chrome | DuckDuckGo | Edge | Firefox |
|--------|--------|------------|------|---------|
| Enable in [settings](https://brave.com/web-standards-at-brave/4-global-privacy-control/) | Download an [extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/search/global%20privacy%20control) | Enable in [settings](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/gpc/) | Download an [add-on](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/search/%22global%20privacy%20control%22) | Enable in [settings](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/global-privacy-control) |


**How do I tell if it's working?** If you visit [globalprivacycontrol.org](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/), a banner will appear to confirm your GPC flag is flying. Some websites will also let you know that they saw your flag with a small indicator or banner. You also might notice fewer annoying cookie banners. 


---GPCNotDo
title: What does GPC *not* do?
---

* GPC does not protect you from all forms of tracking and sharing. It does not usually protect your data from government agencies.
* GPC will not delete or erase data collected by websites. 
* GPC is not respected by all websites.


---GPCDownsides
title: Are there any downsides?

The risks of enabling GPC are low. If you are a big fan of targeted advertising, you might be disappointed to miss out on some targeted ads. 

There's a chance that the GPC flag could be misused by websites for browser fingerprinting.
